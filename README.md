    An app that I would like to build is a note-taking app with various 
    quality-of-life features. I want to implement a security feature to lock 
    notes, Pomodoro timers, an attachment feature to include picture, document, 
    and scanned attachments. The file-management system will also give the option 
    to export the note to different document types, as well as work with touch 
    support.

## Notes

    The baseline application was not very difficult to build, however, I also 
    implemented a way to change the color of the text as well by calling the 
    changeColor() function. I had a lot of difficulty with many connections being 
    made between the outlets and connecting it to code functionality/logic. There 
    was a persistent execution error that was resolved by removing the unused 
    connections in Connections Inspector.
